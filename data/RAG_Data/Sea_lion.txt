Sea lions haul out in large colonies on rocks and sandy shores on the Islands. They move into the water to feed and cool off as needed.

STATUS - Endangered

The sea lion is the most common mammal in the Galápagos.

Introduced species, such as dogs, carry diseases that can spread to sea lions. They are vulnerable to the effects of climate change on ocean currents, which impacts their fish prey abundance. They are also victims of bycatch in fisheries.

Sea lions often rest aboard fishing boats, sometimes causing the boats to sink. Fishermen try to prevent them from coming aboard by putting up barbwire as a barrier, but this causes severe injuries to the sea lions. WWF helped support a project on San Cristóbal Island that built and installed two floating bases for sea lions to rest on and a “primary care nursery” for sea lions and other species. Environmental education and communication awareness sessions were offered about the importance of sea lions and the problems with their interaction with the local community. Currently, sea lions are using the floating bases more often and we expect less sea lion injuries and fewer troubles for the boat owners on the island.
